# Automating Crypto Data Collection with Python

## Overview
This project demonstrates the automation of data collection from a cryptocurrency API using Python. Through this tutorial, you'll learn how to set up a script to pull data from the CoinMarketCap API, organize it, clean it, and visualize it for analysis.

## Project Highlights
- **Adding Timestamps:** Keep track of automation runs by adding timestamps to your data.
- **Creating API Retrieval Function:** Build a reusable function to fetch data from the API.
- **Automating API Calls:** Utilize loops to automate repeated API calls for continuous data updates.
- **Handling Errors and Troubleshooting:** Implement error handling mechanisms to address common issues during automation.
- **Data Cleaning and Organization:** Prepare the data for visualization by cleaning and organizing it appropriately.
- **Preparing Data Frame for Visualization:** Structure the data into a DataFrame suitable for visualization.
- **Creating Visualizations:** Utilize libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib to create insightful visualizations.
- **Focusing on Specific Columns:** Highlight specific columns for in-depth analysis and insights.
- **Encouraging Exploration:** Emphasize the abundance of available data and encourage viewers to explore further and customize their analyses.

## Tools Used
- Python: Programming language used for scripting and automation.
- requests library: Used for making HTTP requests to the CoinMarketCap API.
